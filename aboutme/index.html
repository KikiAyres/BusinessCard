      <h1>My story</h1>
      <p>I'm Cristine Ayres, best know as Kiki, I'm 40 years and I have recently discovery my passion for codding. I'm a
        simple woman who likes nature and travel. I'm also an electrician who enjoys building and repairing things.</p>

      <P>As a career transitioning professional, currently completing my final year in Analysis and Systems Development,
        I'm looking forward to a job opportunity in the field.</P>

      <h2>KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE</h2>
      <p>
        I have worked for many years in customer service and sales. I worked with Trier's pharmacy management system as
        an instructor, where I found a passion for the IT field. In college, I only learned theory. So, to expand my
        knowledge, I learned programming through videos on YouTube, with the help of my brother and my boyfriend who are
        also programmers. I've advanced spoken and written English skills; however, I still need assistance with
        writing, which I'd consider intermediate. I'm organized, methodical, committed, proactive, and enjoy challenges
        that allow me to grow professionally."
